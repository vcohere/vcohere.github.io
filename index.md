## Experience

I started working as a Web Development Consultant in [OnePoint](https://www.groupeonepoint.com/en/) in 2015. Over the next 2 years, I was developing websites and cross-platform apps for clients. Working in the Innovation "part" of the company, most of my projects were proof of concepts, under tight deadlines.

In 2017 I decided to try and work for a smaller agency, to get a more hands-on experience working when it comes to working with clients. I got hired in [Sigmapix](http://www.sigmapix.com/), a 4-person WordPress & Symphony web agency. The team being mainly back-end developers, I was in charge of designing the WordPress websites for our clients.

And finally, from 2018 to 2019 I worked as a freelance web developer, using the network I created over the last few years.

## My work

You can find a case study I did for a fictional client [here](/), in this I go in detail about my web designing process. From prototyping to building a custom WordPress theme with custom plugins.
