## Client's needs

The client is Dance Republic, an Australian nightclub. This company is completely fictional, and I came up with their needs just as an interesting exercise.

- Ability to take bookings online
- Display all the events coming up soon
- Being able to edit the events themselves in the back-end
- Contact form

## Design

### Wireframes

I always like to start with simple wireframing. Using Adobe XD I create the wireframes, link all the pages together, and send it to the client so they can start playing with a first "working" prototype.

The client can start sending me feedback and we can make modifications now, as they are easier to do on wireframes than on a full design.

I always like to start with the mobile screen first, and in general have a mobile-first approach.

### UI Design

Once the client approves the wireframes, I can start designing. Usually at this stage, I already have an idea of how the website will look like. So I just have to get started in Adobe XD.

In this case, the website is for a nightclub so it will obviously be on a black background. For the accent colors, I chose #fff and #fff.

This was made in Adobe XD, some elements were modified in Photoshop first.
