# Dance Republic Case Study

Dance Republic is a fictional nightclub, for which I created a fully custom WordPress website.

You can download all the files (Prototypes, code, etc) on my [Github repository](#).

This Case Study will be split into 3 sections :

1. Design
2. Theme Creation
3. Deployment

## Design

The first step to designing a website is making wireframes. Wireframes are rough design prototypes, simply showing what shape and size each element will appear, as well as where on the page.

Making wireframes makes it easy to avoid design flaws (which would be time-consuming to fix) before we start making the final design.
