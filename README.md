## Dance Republic Case Study

Dance Republic is a fictional nightclub, for which I created a fully custom WordPress website.

This Case Study will be split into 3 sections :

1. Design

3. Deployment

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/vcohere/vcohere.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
