# Dance Republic Case Study

Dance Republic is a fictional nightclub, for which I created a fully custom WordPress website.

You can download all the files (Prototypes, code, etc) on my [Github repository](#).

This Case Study will be split into 3 sections :

1. Design
2. Theme Creation
3. Deployment

## Design

Today we will be using Adobe XD to create the first prototype, and Photoshop when necessary.

68.1% of all website visits in 2020 were from a mobile phone. Because of this, I strongly believe in the mobile-first design philosophy. So, let's start with designing the mobile version first.
